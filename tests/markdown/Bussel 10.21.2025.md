### Contracts: Promise Enforcement Beyond Bargain - Past Consideration, Moral Obligation, and Statutory Alternatives

**I. The Limits of the Traditional Consideration Doctrine**

- **Traditional View:** The doctrine of **consideration** was once seen as an essential and exclusive element for **promise enforcement**.
- **Modern Understanding:** **Consideration** is now understood as just one basis for **promise enforcement**, not the only one. There are alternative doctrines for enforcing promises made outside the context of a **bargain**.
- **Bias Against Gift Promises:** The common law is presumptively against enforcing **gift promises** (promises made outside a bargain context). This bias is driven by two primary concerns:
  - **Improvident Donors:** Protecting individuals who make foolish or emotionally-driven promises they may later regret.
  - **Ungrateful Promisees:** A sense that the recipient of a gratuitous promise may be undeserving of legal enforcement.
- **Comparative Law Note:** Civil law systems (e.g., Germany, France) do not share this bias and generally enforce **gift promises**, but they have well-developed doctrines to protect against **improvident donors** and **ungrateful promisees**.

**II. The Rule of Past Consideration**

- **General Rule:** The core principle is that **"past consideration is no consideration."**
  - This phrase is an oxymoron because the essence of **consideration** is a _present_ **bargain for exchange**.
  - A promise made in recognition of a benefit previously conferred in the past is considered a **gift promise** and is therefore presumptively unenforceable.

**III. Case Law on Moral Obligation and Past Consideration**

- **_Case Example: Dementas v. Estate of Tallas_ (Referred to as "DeSantis" v. McWilliams/Upper Deck in lecture)**

  - **_Facts:_** An attorney for a startup baseball card company ("Sartain") arranged a crucial $100,000 loan to save the company. The money was wired immediately. Shortly after, at a board meeting, the grateful board promised the attorney 3% of the company's stock. The company became wildly successful, making the 3% worth $33 million. The company later reneged on the promise, and the attorney sued. A jury found for the attorney, but the judge granted a **motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV)**, overturning the verdict.
  - **_Issue:_** Was the promise of 3% stock an enforceable **bargain** or an unenforceable **gift promise**?
  - **_Holding:_** The promise was an unenforceable **gift promise**.
  - **_Reasoning:_** The court found that the service (arranging the loan) was performed _before_ the promise of stock was made. Therefore, the service constituted **past consideration**, which is no **consideration**.
  - **_Underlying Factor (Rules of Professional Responsibility):_** The court's decision was heavily influenced by the fact that the promisee was the company's attorney.
    - If the transaction had been a **bargain**, the attorney would have violated the **rules of professional responsibility** by entering into a business transaction with his client without advising them to seek independent counsel.
    - Such an arrangement would be an **illegal contract**, providing an independent reason for unenforceability. The court avoids this by classifying the promise as a gift.
  - **_Lecture Analysis:_**
    - The court's reasoning on timing is "quite thin," as the loan and promise occurred on the same day.
    - The case involves an **improvident donor** problem, as the board made an emotional, spontaneous promise in a moment of crisis.
    - The damages ($33 million) seem highly disproportionate to the benefit received (arranging a $100k loan), which likely influenced the judge.
    - The court completely ignored **California Civil Code § 1606**, which explicitly states that a **moral obligation** arising from a past benefit is "good **consideration**" to an extent. This statute could have provided a basis for a more limited, proportional remedy, similar to **quantum meruit**.

- **_Case Example: Mills v. Wyman_**

  - **_Facts:_** The plaintiff, an innkeeper, acted as a **Good Samaritan** and cared for the defendant's 25-year-old adult son, who was sick and indigent, until the son died. After learning of this, the defendant father wrote to the plaintiff, promising to pay for the expenses incurred. The father later refused to pay.
  - **_Holding:_** The father's promise was unenforceable.
  - **_Reasoning:_**
    - The promise lacked **consideration** because the care was provided before the promise was made (**past consideration**).
    - The court acknowledged the father had a strong **moral obligation** to pay but declared that **moral obligation** alone is not a legally sufficient basis for **promise enforcement**.
    - The court distinguished this from three recognized exceptions where a past obligation can support a new promise:
      1.  A promise to pay a debt barred by the **statute of limitations**.
      2.  A promise by an adult to pay a debt incurred as a **minor**.
      3.  A promise to pay a debt discharged in **bankruptcy**.
    - The court reasoned these exceptions are valid because an original **legal obligation** (supported by **consideration**) existed at the outset; the new promise merely waives a subsequent legal bar to enforcement. In _Mills_, there was never a pre-existing legal obligation between the father and the innkeeper.

- **_Case Example: Webb v. McGowin_**

  - **_Facts:_** The plaintiff (Webb) saved his co-worker (McGowin) from death or serious injury by diverting a falling 75-pound block, severely and permanently injuring himself in the process. In gratitude, McGowin promised to pay Webb $15 every two weeks for the rest of Webb's life. McGowin made these payments for seven years until his death. McGowin's estate then refused to continue the payments.
  - **_Holding:_** The promise was enforceable against McGowin's estate.
  - **_Reasoning:_** The court created an exception to the **past consideration** rule. A promise made in recognition of a **moral obligation** can be sufficient **consideration** where the promisor has received a significant **material benefit**.
  - **_Distinctions from Mills v. Wyman:_**
    - **Benefit:** The benefit in _Webb_ (saving a life) was direct, immense, and material, unlike the smaller, indirect benefit in _Mills_.
    - **Performance:** McGowin performed the promise for seven years, demonstrating his intent to be bound. The father in _Mills_ never performed.
    - **Context of Promise:** McGowin's promise was made weeks after the event, suggesting deliberation. The father's promise in _Mills_ was made under the immediate emotion of grief.
    - **Proportionality:** The payments in _Webb_ were a modest, reasonable amount.

**IV. Modern Approaches to Moral Obligation**

- **Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 86**

  - This section effectively codifies the rule from _Webb v. McGowin_.
  - It states that a promise made in recognition of a **benefit previously received** by the promisor from the promisee is binding to the extent necessary to **prevent injustice**.
  - The Restatement's commentary confirms that a promise like the one in _Mills v. Wyman_ would _not_ be enforceable under this section, preserving the traditional rule for less extreme cases.

- **Statutory Solutions**
  - **California Civil Code § 1606:** Provides that an existing **moral obligation** arising from a past benefit constitutes "good **consideration**," but limits the remedy "to the extent" of the obligation, allowing for proportional enforcement.
  - **New York Statute:** Rejects a flexible, justice-based standard in favor of a bright-line formality. A promise based on **past consideration** is enforceable _if and only if_ it is in writing and signed by the promisor.
    - **Critique:** This formalistic approach leads to results contrary to the equities of the cases. Under New York law, the written promise in _Mills_ would be enforced, while the (presumably oral) promise in _Webb_ would not.

**Black Letter Law Summary**

- **Past Consideration:** A promise based on a benefit previously conferred is not supported by valid **consideration** and is generally unenforceable. **"Past consideration is no consideration."**
- **Moral Obligation (General Rule):** A promise made solely out of a sense of **moral obligation** is generally not legally enforceable. (_Mills v. Wyman_)
- **Exception for Material Benefit:** A promise made in recognition of a significant **material benefit** previously received by the promisor may be enforced to the extent necessary to prevent injustice. (_Webb v. McGowin_ and Restatement § 86)
- **Exceptions for Pre-Existing Legal Obligations:** A new promise to perform an obligation that has become unenforceable due to a rule of law (e.g., **statute of limitations**, discharge in **bankruptcy**, infancy) is binding without new **consideration**. The new promise is treated as a waiver of the legal defense.
- **Statutory Variations:** Some jurisdictions have created statutory rules for enforcing promises based on past benefits.
  - **California:** A **moral obligation** can serve as "good **consideration**," with the remedy being limited.
  - **New York:** A promise based on **past consideration** is enforceable if it is in writing and signed.
