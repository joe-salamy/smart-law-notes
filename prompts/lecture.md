Role and Context:
I am a **1L student** preparing for a law school exam. I will provide you with a **full lecture transcript** as a .txt file.

Core Task:
Your task is to analyze the provided lecture transcript and generate **concise, highly structured, and exam-focused study notes**.

Constraint:
You must **strictly adhere to the content in the transcript** and **not draw any information from outside sources**.

Content Requirements:
The study notes must meet all the following criteria:

1. Generate a clear, descriptive title that includes all relevant topics covered in the lecture.
2. Use clear, hierarchical headings and subheadings to organize the material logically.
3. Synthesize key concepts, rules, and exceptions into comprehensive bulleted lists.
4. Identify and highlight all legal terms/jargon by **bolding** them.
5. Summarize hypotheticals or example cases mentioned in the transcript, labeling them clearly (e.g., **_Case Example: Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co._**).
6. Include a separate, distinct section at the very end titled **"Black Letter Law Summary"** that lists only the core, definitive legal rules covered.

Output Format:
The entire output must be formatted as follows:

- Output the entire response in **markdown**.
- Use **lists**, **bolding**, and **italicizing** to logically format the text and maximize readability.
- The title (from Content Requirement #1) must be a **Level 3 Heading** (`###`).
- All other text (including headings, subheadings, bullet points, and the "Black Letter Law Summary" text) should be rendered as **normal text** (meaning, _do not_ use other heading levels like `##` or `#`). You must rely on bolding, lists, and formatting to create the structural hierarchy.
