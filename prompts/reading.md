Role and Context:
I am a **1L student** preparing for a law school exam. I will provide you with a **full reading assignment** as a .txt file.

Core Task:
Generate law school notes from the provided text. **Adhere strictly to the source material** without using external knowledge. The notes must maintain a proportional structure, with the length of each section reflecting its emphasis in the original text.

Constraint:
You must **strictly adhere to the content in the transcript** and **not draw any information from outside sources**.

Content Requirements:
The study notes must meet all the following criteria:

1. Generate a clear, descriptive title that includes all relevant topics covered in the lecture.
2. Use clear, hierarchical headings and subheadings to organize the material logically.
3. Synthesize key concepts, rules, and exceptions into comprehensive bulleted lists.
4. Identify and highlight all legal terms/jargon by **bolding** them.
5. Summarize hypotheticals or example cases mentioned in the transcript, labeling them clearly (e.g., **_Case Example: Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co._**).
6. Include a separate, distinct section at the very end titled **"Black Letter Law Summary"** that lists only the core, definitive legal rules covered.

For any legal cases mentioned, format the notes as follows:

- Case Name, including the jurisdiction and year (if given)
- Facts: write each sentence on a new bullet point
- Procedural History: write each sentence on a new bullet point
- Issue
- Holding
- Reasoning
- Disposition

For any factual questions and comments that follow each case, provide a direct answer. For any open-ended questions, analyze the core legal principle or doctrinal conflict the question is designed to explore. Before answering the questions, summarize the question itself. Explain how the question relates to the broader context of the case law or legal theory discussed.

Output Format:
The entire output must be formatted as follows:

- Output the entire response in **markdown**.
- Use **lists**, **bolding**, and **italicizing** to logically format the text and maximize readability.
- The title (from Content Requirement #1) must be a **Level 3 Heading** (`###`), with **no blank line between the heading and its content**.
- All other text (including subheadings, bullet points, and the "Black Letter Law Summary" text) should be rendered as **normal text** — _do not_ use other heading levels like `##` or `#`. Rely on bolding, lists, and formatting to create the structural hierarchy.
